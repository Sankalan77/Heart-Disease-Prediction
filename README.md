# Heart-Disease-Prediction
💓 Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
<br>
📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a predictive system that can determine the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on clinical and physiological parameters. Using multiple machine learning algorithms, the model helps in early diagnosis and risk assessment, supporting doctors and patients in making informed healthcare decisions.

🎯# Objectives

•	Analyze patient data to identify patterns associated with heart disease.
•	Compare the performance of different machine learning models.
•	Build a predictive model that can classify patients as “at risk” or “not at risk.”


🧩# Dataset

The dataset used contains various medical attributes such as:

•	Age
•	Sex
•	Chest Pain Type (cp)
•	Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)
•	Cholesterol (chol)
•	Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)
•	Resting ECG (restecg)
•	Maximum Heart Rate (thalach)
•	Exercise Induced Angina (exang)
•	Oldpeak, Slope, CA, and Thal


These attributes help determine whether a patient is likely to have heart disease.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The notebook performs EDA to understand the distribution of features, detect correlations, and visualize the relationships between key attributes and the target variable (presence of heart disease).

🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

Several supervised classification algorithms are implemented and compared, including:

•	Logistic Regression
•	Naive Bayes
•	Support Vector Machine (SVM)
•	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
•	Decision Tree
•	Random Forest
•	XGBoost


Each model is trained and evaluated to determine accuracy and robustness on test data.

🧠 Model Evaluation

The models are assessed using metrics such as:

•	Accuracy
•	Precision
•	Recall
•	F1-Score

Finally, the best-performing algorithm is chosen based on its ability to correctly predict heart disease cases.

🏁 Results

The project achieves promising accuracy across multiple classifiers, demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning in medical diagnosis tasks.
